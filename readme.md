ASFLIP Demo
================
![example](https://github.com/raymondyfei/pyasflip/assets/5384915/d0f3562d-79cb-4995-b980-0bdd8c9161f3)

This is a Python implementation of the ASFLIP advection method in paper [Revisiting Integration in the Material Point Method: A Scheme for Easier Separation and Less Dissipation](https://raymondyfei.github.io/asflip/). We would like to hear from you if you appreciate this work.

Dependencies
--------------------
This demo depends on [Taichi](https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi). You may follow its [documentation](https://docs.taichi.graphics/) for installation, or simply type `pip install taichi` under a Python 3 environment.

Run the Demo
--------------------
To run the demo, simply type `python pyasflip.py` under a Python 3 environment with Taichi installed.

Press R to reset; `Space` to pause/start the simulation; `Left`/`Right` to switch between advection schemes.
